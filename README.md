# Description

This repo was created with Phoenix's default starter template.
1. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#phoenix (installing phx.new command/generator)
2. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html (running it with a folder name to generate a template project)

Then, the oban packages were added to mix.exs.

A renovate.json was also added.

Notice in mix.exs, a custom repo is specified for oban_web and oban_pro. That repo is usually added beforehand with this command. Hex in Elixir supports using custom repos from sources that are not hex.pm.

https://hexdocs.pm/hex/Mix.Tasks.Hex.Repo.html

You can add a repo and reference it with that custom name in your mix.exs.

Note that the command line options are optional, but still important - the custom repo we use requires --fetch-public-key and --auth-key.

See here for the specific config we use: https://hexdocs.pm/oban/2.11.0/pro_installation.html#authentication


# Error generated by bot
Whenever any elixir dependency is attempted to be updated, it will fail with an error like this.

I've redacted the specific project name from the real output.

```

### Below is what the phx starter template automatically generates.

# RenovateHexExternalRepo

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
